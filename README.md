# GGJ2011 Light Cylinders

This repository contains the original prototype for the game **Light Cylinders**, created during the **Global Game Jam 2011** at **[ISART Digital Paris](https://www.isart.fr/)**. The theme that year was *"Extinction"*. 

In this game, the player must jump between glowing cylinders that gradually "extinguish" as time passes, while a light source attached to the player creates an immersive 3D atmosphere. The gameplay is controlled entirely with the mouse.

The prototype was developed using:
- **GameStart 3D**: an early version of what would later become the [HARFANG 3D engine](https://github.com/harfang3d/harfang3d).
- **Squirrel**: a lightweight [scripting language](https://github.com/albertodemichelis/squirrel).

While the game was recreated in Unity for the final GGJ release, this repository preserves the original prototype, including the scripts and mechanics, as a testament to the rapid prototyping process that could be achieved with GameStart 3D during the jam.

### "Key" Features (erm, for a 12h prototype)
- Dynamic light and movement mechanics.
- Procedurally spawned cylinders.
- Minimalist, monochromatic visual style.

Feel free to explore or adapt this code to your own projects. This repository aims to preserve the spirit of experimentation and collaboration fostered by game jams :)
